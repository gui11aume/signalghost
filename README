The package signalghost provides functions for resampling a signal with the GHOST method. GHOST permutations have an auto-correlation similar to that of the original signal if the latter is stationary. GHOST permutations also allow to resample a signal only at certain scales.

Please do not copy-paste the code. Instead, use 'git clone git@github.com:g1illa1me/signalghost.git' to have the full version history.

The code is here for reproducibility and mistake-tracking purposes, but feel free to copy, reuse and modify it in any way you like.
